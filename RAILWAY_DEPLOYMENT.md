# 🚀 Railway Production Deployment Guide

## FlowCRM Backend API Production Setup

**Result**: Production API at `https://your-app-name.railway.app` with PostgreSQL database, JWT authentication, and automatic deployments.

---

## 🎯 Our Proven Deployment Strategy

### **Repository Structure:**
- **`main` branch**: Full-stack development (frontend + backend)
- **`railway-backend` branch**: Production API deployment (backend only)

### **Deployment Approach:**
- ⚡ **Railway CLI** (10x faster than dashboard)
- 🎯 **Backend-only branch** (avoids frontend build issues)
- 🔒 **Automatic database setup** with migrations and seeds

---

## ⚡ Quick Railway CLI Deployment

### **1. Install Railway CLI**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### **2. Switch to Backend Branch**
```bash
cd your-flowcrm-project
git checkout railway-backend
```

### **3. Lightning Fast Deploy (2 minutes total)**
```bash
# Login to Railway (opens browser)
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Generate and set secure JWT secret
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")

# Set environment variables
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production

# Add PostgreSQL database (if not already added)
railway add --database postgresql

# Deploy instantly!
railway up
```

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### **Test API Endpoints:**
```bash
# Health Check
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health

# Create Test User
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"password123","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","role":"user"}'

# Login Test
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"password123"}'
```

### **Database Verification:**
1. **Railway Dashboard → Database**
2. **"Connect"** → **"psql"** (opens database terminal)
3. Run: `\dt` (list tables)
4. Should see: `users`, `contacts`, `companies`, `deals`, etc.

## 🌍 Frontend Configuration

### **Update Frontend for Production:**

**In `frontend/src/utils/api.js`:**
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 
  (import.meta.env.PROD ? 'https://your-app-name.railway.app/api' : 'http://localhost:5000/api');
```

**Add to `frontend/.env.production`:**
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app/api
```

**Redeploy frontend after backend is live:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run deploy  # Updates GitHub Pages with production API
```
